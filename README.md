# Sudoku
Now, since Saurav has updated with the solution.java file. We can now design the game.
What we can do is, generate the game first using main.java file. Use a function to randomly put zeroes in the grid. Pass that grid to the functions in solution.java file to solve and display the solution when user "quits" or clicks "show solution" button.
